# Anime Recommender System:

A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system. In this project I attempted to predict the "rating" or "preference" that the user would give the item or in this case the anime.

## Dataset
The dataset was collected from Kaggle, we collected anime details, profile information and rating information. I chose features such as Title, Type, Source, Episodes, Score, Rank, Popularity, Genre and Rating.

## Algorithm

In this project I specifically explored non-probabilistic filtering algorithms such as:

User based filtering Item based filtering Rating based filtering Content based filtering
